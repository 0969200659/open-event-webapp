Open Event Webapp

The Open Event Webapp

The webapp is a generic app that has two parts: a) A standard configuration file, that sets the details of the app (e.g. color scheme, logo of event, link to JSON app data) b) The webapp itself

##Features
The Open Event Web App closely resembles the Android App. It will show 
 1. Speakers
 2. Sessions
 3. Tracks
 4. Map
From the event, with latest available data. 
It will be responsive, so that it can be viewed from all screen sizes easily. 
The data will be fetched dynamically from the API endpoint provided by the ![orga-server](https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-orga-server). 

##Technology
The webapp will be written using only HTML, CSS and Javascript, so it is completely client-side renderable, on all kinds of browsers, including PCs and smartphones and tablets. This should also make it easy to wrap into a Ionic/Phonegapp app for multiple mobile platforms.
